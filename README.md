## Review: `<form>`, `<div>`, CSS flexbox, CSS grid `auto-fit` vs `auto-fill`

## Nov 28 
Going on a bit more with Udemy. Since this is a 0-to-expert course, these first few lessons/videos are pretty basic and a little bit boring. Don't want to skip them and then need to backtrack, though, so doing them anyway!

## Nov 27
**Finished the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course!** It says it's a 300 hour course, and while I'm not sure how long it actually took, I am proud of what I did. I may end up going back into the projects and updating them a bit, since they are somewhat messy, but looking at what I started with and ended up with is a pretty noticeable difference (at least to me) and the ease at which I was able to make that improvement is also nice.

Started a bit on the Javascript course, but I think I should switch gears and still keep pushing the HTML/CSS stuff, so I've moved over to the Udemy course that I bought last month.

## Nov 26
Still on project #5. Getting most stuff done a bit easier. Things like setting width/height and the flexbox are getting just a tiny bit more natural. 

I'm still looking up quite a bit of info, but at least now it takes me a lot less time to both **look up** and **implement** the things I don't know off the top of my head. Small progress for sure, but moving forward (however slowly) is still moving forward.

## Nov 22
Finished projet number 4! Getting a bit better, but still feels like there is a long way to go before I am comfortable or know *how* to do some sort of layout before I try a few different commands and figure out how it works through trial and error. 

**Progress!**

## Nov 21 
Gradually seem to be getting better at getting my eye in as far as thinking about both *how* I want a layout to look and *how* to achieve that layout. Still have to consult the CSS and HTML references quite a bit (which will likely be the case for awhile until I get more used to the **incredibly wide array of commands and how they are all subtley different**, but for now, I'm seeing real progress with how much I understand and how much I can do by hand.

## Nov 20
Getting the hang of some of this stuff, but all the formatting and alignment commands and syntax is more than a little bit confusing for me. Hopefully plugging away at it will help, but I'm trying to not just fall back on the easiest "words on a page" look to force myself to improve.

## Nov 17
Whew. `flexbox` plus the `@media` query is a tiny bit of a head trip. It's really interesting to me how I can think vertically fairly easily, but trying to pre-plan how I want stuff to be spaced horizontally (especially on different sized screens) is not one of my natural strengths.  It probably doesn't help that I'm trying to learn the syntax and the different commands all at the same time, but what's wrong with drinking from the firehose every now and then?

## Nov 16
Finished up the form page yesterday, but spent about an hour afterwards playing around with the CSS to see (more) of how it worked. The forms aren't quite as confusing now (although I'm still not 100% sure on them), but some of the different CSS functions are getting mixed up in my head. Glad that they have these projects, though, since actually starting from a blank slate is a great way to be pushed into the deep end.

Starting now on the product landing page. Trying to see if I can make this one look at little bit more 2000's and less 1990's Geocities.

Oh man. These `<form>` tags and the formatting CSS is just a bit more confusing than I thought it would be. I'm making progress, (I think), but it is a bit confusing at this point. One thing I need to be more proactive about is a much more liberal use of `<div>` tags to make sure that formatting is easier to do via CSS.

## Nov 13
Started working on FreeCodeCamp project 2 - a form. Yay. some of these different fields and the syntax for them is confusing. 

For example, having `<input type="text">` for a single-line text field, but `<textarea>` for a multi-line text field is one of those things I'll just have to do more to commit to memory (or just always look it up). Not the biggest deal, but I definitely need to review the `<id>` and `<name>` attributes and how they are used differently.

## Nov 12
Got the first project out of the way. Needed to have a bit of help by looking at the framework of an already-completed one, but I got it done and was playing around with some of the layout and CSS at the end. It's certainly not great, but I think it's a good start, and starting from scratch is quite different than modifying already-existing code. 

You can see it [over at CodePen.com](https://codepen.io/csdorman/pen/QJKoMm). 

## Nov 10
Got done with the first section(s) of the FreeCodeCamp front-end learning! Now on to a few projects. I went ahead and made a CodePen.io account, but I'm not sure if I want to use that or dive into using Atom or another standard text editor. Torn between wanting some live-preview feedback and not trying to think things through *before* putting them down. So I don't learn bad habits anymore than necessary.

## Nov 9
More CSS fun!

Finished up the relatively easy color/accessability work, and then moved on to some responsive design and flexbox CSS voodoo. A lot of this stuff is making quite a bit of sense (although there are still a few weird things), but I really need to go back and review some of the more basic layout fundamentals. I think I'm getting some of the moderate to advanced stuff, I think there's a bit of a gap in my understanding of the layout on a more fundamental level that is keeping me from really internalizing how some of this stuff is put together.

## Nov 8 
Got in about 15 minutes at 6:30 this AM before working all day. Super glad that I made the time.

Also, `<forms>` are still crazy to me for some reason. I'll need to do some more brushing up on them sometime soon.

Getting into colorblindess accessability guidelines. Right in my wheelhouse!
## Nov 7
Moved on from the CSS crazy stuff to some accessability. Relatively easy to remember this stuff, since lots of this has SEO functionality or carryover (`<alt>` attributes are important for search engines to recognize pictures and context), so not to bad. Stopped right before the combination of accessability and `<form>` combination, so we'll see how it goes tomorrow!

## Nov 6
Finished the CSS portion of the Freecodecamp and like normal, there seems to be a progression in the middle that I am not understanding as fast as they go through it. That's almost certainly since I'm doing this on my own (without lots of homework on constant immersion, but the idea of creating shapes out of divs with the `.Something::after` and `.something::before` sub-classes messes with my head. 

The animation stuff was pretty neat, but also I feel like I just have to constantly stare at the code to figure out how it's all put together. Overall, though, I feel like I know more now, and I'm not totally underwater! Hooray!

## Nov 5
More CSS fun. Skewing, hsl() for color, hue, and shading, complimentary and tertiary colors. Fun times!

## Nov 4
Lots more CSS today. This stuff is both logical and slightly confusing. I feel better and more secure about what's going on after spending even 15 minutes with it, but I'll be glad to get through more of this stuff and into the slightly more complex stuff that is going to be newer and (probably) harder to grok. Trying to make sure that I go slow enought to really comprehend what I'm doing now, though.

The `fixed`, `relative`, and `absolute` CSS position indicators are starting to make sense now, too. 

## Nov 3
More and more CSS. Going over things like variables, the specific heirerarchy of how the CSS works is pretty neat. I was working on a project last year that would have been quite a bit easier if I was a bit more familiar with the specifics of how these sheets worked at a deeper level, instead of trying to do research while solving problems!

## Nov 2
Been a couple of days since I last commented here, but I have been doing a bit of learning every day, although not quite as much as I want to d. So far *most* things are a review. The `<form>` HTML was a bit weird, and I need to make sure that I check up on the differences between the `.class` selector and the `#id` attribute, but so far most stuff has been a review.

## Oct 31
After reading the great blog article by  [Syk Houdeib](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-switched-careers-and-got-a-developer-job-in-10-months-a-true-story-b8895e855a8b), it inspired me to (once again) resume learning (in a structured way) basic and advanced web languages. 

I've gotten by for awhile on bits and pieces (and Google-fu), but I think a more thorough understanding of the basics will help me a lot in getting more freelance web devel work.

Started going through some of the great resources over at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and while the HTML stuff was pretty easy, I didn't realize how confusing some of the `<form>` code could be, since I've always done it via plugins. Phew.
  
  On to the CSS stuff tomorrow!
