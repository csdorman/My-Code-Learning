## Review: `<div>`, CSS flexbox, CSS grid `auto-fit` vs `auto-fill`

## Dec 12
Started working with the CSS grid in today's lesson. It wasn't as difficult as I thought it might be. The CSS `float` property was a bit new, but it seemed to be much easier than the `flexbox` or whatever it was that I was doing earlier.

This is a pretty strong case for having a person-to-person connection going on instead of just reading (and sometimes zoning out) web pages or reference docs. I feel like I'm actually getting better at some of this stuff, and Sublime is pretty neat as well.

### Part 2!

Finished up the minimalist blog in under an hour. Got stuck a couple of times but was able to do *almost* everything without any sort of help. Did things slightly differently than the "solution", but still got it all accomplished and it looks the same. Super cool. Looks like tomorrow starts Javascript stuff - that's when I'm definitely going to be more than a little bit underwater (maybe). We'll see!

## Dec 11
The tic-tac-toe board wasn't too bad. I guess I figured it would be made of `<div>` and `<span>`, but instead it was just a *relatively* simple table with selective borders turned on. I was able to get it done without any help, and I don't know if I would have been able to do that quite so easily a month (or more) ago.

## Dec 10
Been a few days since I've updated here, but I haven't (yet) missed a day of going through *something*. 39-day streak so far!

Today was a trip through lots of font and text CSS, which I'm already familiar with. Tomorrow looks like it's going to be going over the box model, so I hope that I'm able to carve out a bnch of time, since that's still a bit confusing to me. The exercise/project that goes along with the box model, the tic-tac-toe board, looks pretty interesting, though, and so hopefully that will help me get my head around it!

## Dec 5
Finished the Udemy form exercise, and I think that some of the `<form>` confusion finally clicked just now.

The `<label for="">` tag is to link the text label with the `<input id="">`. The `name` attribute in the `<input>` tag is what is shown in the database or URL bar (or whereever the form's data goes). The `value` attribute is on the other side of the form data field. So in the database (or wherever) it is `name` = `value`. For whatever reason I assumed the HTML `id` attribute would be used in the database, but it looks like the `id` is only used to link up two HTML elements on the page (and also for CSS purposes).

Phew!

## Dec 4
Doing the forms exam (at least the first one).

Got pretty far without needing to look up stuff. The big confusing part at this point is the difference in `<for>, <id>,`and  `<name>`.

Need to try and keep those straigh. Also, right now some of the data is not showing up in the address bar when submitted. Pretty much out of time to work on it today, but I'll try and do some debugging of it tomorrow.

## Dec 3
Starting on Udemy forms.

This definitely makes a bit more sense. It's hard to tell if it's the subtely different explanation, the slower introduction, or the fact that they separated the front end (what you see) from the backend (which actually does the work) in the form.

It was very interesting to see them submit a form to a URL (wikipedia.org) that they had no relationship with. That makes the design of it (and the code that goes into the design) totally separate from the backend stuff. This is, of course, the case, but I don't think I had realized quite the extent that they were separate.

## Dec 2
Going through tables in the Udemy course. Pretty easy. Looking forward(?) to *Forms: Part Deux* tomorrow. I wonder if it will be easier to follow along when it's a lecture/teacher instead of just trying to read and comprehend it myself.

## Dec 1
I **knew** that there was a good reason to go over even the introductory videos for this Udemy course. Not only have I learned quite a bit about some of the shortcuts in Sublime (and they are pretty sweet!) but I *finally* get the difference betweent a `<div>` and a `<span>` element. Basic, but now I know!

Also, finished the two Intro to HTML quizzes pretty easily. I know that they were quite basic, but I did feel even more ahead of the curve thanks to some of the prior FreeCodeCamp work and studying I've done. On to Intermediate HTML next!
## Nov 30
Been doing this for a whole month and while I have been doing quite a bit of reviewing (since most of these courses assume no-to-very-little prior knowledge), I do feel like I've gotten a bit more comfortable with typing in raw HTML/CSS and having a pretty decent idea of what will come out.

Today's Udemy course was still quite a bit of a review, but I got a first look at Sublime and some of it's shortcuts and they seem pretty nice. I'll need to do some research with syncing things up (in case I need to do this learning on multiple computers), but so far I like Sublime a bit more that Atom.

Also, today I found about the Mozilla Developer Network web docs and resources. Those will likely be a much better resource than the W3C pages that have been a bit of a pain to load and browse.

## Nov 29
More watching of the entry Udemy videos. Don't have a lot of time today, since I'm teaching mostly straight through from 9am to 7pm today. Glad that I got a litle bit in!

## Nov 28 
Going on a bit more with Udemy. Since this is a 0-to-expert course, these first few lessons/videos are pretty basic and a little bit boring. Don't want to skip them and then need to backtrack, though, so doing them anyway!

## Nov 27
**Finished the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course!** It says it's a 300 hour course, and while I'm not sure how long it actually took, I am proud of what I did. I may end up going back into the projects and updating them a bit, since they are somewhat messy, but looking at what I started with and ended up with is a pretty noticeable difference (at least to me) and the ease at which I was able to make that improvement is also nice.

Started a bit on the Javascript course, but I think I should switch gears and still keep pushing the HTML/CSS stuff, so I've moved over to the Udemy course that I bought last month.

## Nov 26
Still on project #5. Getting most stuff done a bit easier. Things like setting width/height and the flexbox are getting just a tiny bit more natural. 

I'm still looking up quite a bit of info, but at least now it takes me a lot less time to both **look up** and **implement** the things I don't know off the top of my head. Small progress for sure, but moving forward (however slowly) is still moving forward.

## Nov 22
Finished projet number 4! Getting a bit better, but still feels like there is a long way to go before I am comfortable or know *how* to do some sort of layout before I try a few different commands and figure out how it works through trial and error. 

**Progress!**

## Nov 21 
Gradually seem to be getting better at getting my eye in as far as thinking about both *how* I want a layout to look and *how* to achieve that layout. Still have to consult the CSS and HTML references quite a bit (which will likely be the case for awhile until I get more used to the **incredibly wide array of commands and how they are all subtley different**, but for now, I'm seeing real progress with how much I understand and how much I can do by hand.

## Nov 20
Getting the hang of some of this stuff, but all the formatting and alignment commands and syntax is more than a little bit confusing for me. Hopefully plugging away at it will help, but I'm trying to not just fall back on the easiest "words on a page" look to force myself to improve.

## Nov 17
Whew. `flexbox` plus the `@media` query is a tiny bit of a head trip. It's really interesting to me how I can think vertically fairly easily, but trying to pre-plan how I want stuff to be spaced horizontally (especially on different sized screens) is not one of my natural strengths.  It probably doesn't help that I'm trying to learn the syntax and the different commands all at the same time, but what's wrong with drinking from the firehose every now and then?

## Nov 16
Finished up the form page yesterday, but spent about an hour afterwards playing around with the CSS to see (more) of how it worked. The forms aren't quite as confusing now (although I'm still not 100% sure on them), but some of the different CSS functions are getting mixed up in my head. Glad that they have these projects, though, since actually starting from a blank slate is a great way to be pushed into the deep end.

Starting now on the product landing page. Trying to see if I can make this one look at little bit more 2000's and less 1990's Geocities.

## Nov 14
Oh man. These `<form>` tags and the formatting CSS is just a bit more confusing than I thought it would be. I'm making progress, (I think), but it is a bit confusing at this point. One thing I need to be more proactive about is a much more liberal use of `<div>` tags to make sure that formatting is easier to do via CSS.

## Nov 13
Started working on FreeCodeCamp project 2 - a form. Yay. some of these different fields and the syntax for them is confusing. 

For example, having `<input type="text">` for a single-line text field, but `<textarea>` for a multi-line text field is one of those things I'll just have to do more to commit to memory (or just always look it up). Not the biggest deal, but I definitely need to review the `<id>` and `<name>` attributes and how they are used differently.

## Nov 12
Got the first project out of the way. Needed to have a bit of help by looking at the framework of an already-completed one, but I got it done and was playing around with some of the layout and CSS at the end. It's certainly not great, but I think it's a good start, and starting from scratch is quite different than modifying already-existing code. 

You can see it [over at CodePen.com](https://codepen.io/csdorman/pen/QJKoMm). 

## Nov 10
Got done with the first section(s) of the FreeCodeCamp front-end learning! Now on to a few projects. I went ahead and made a CodePen.io account, but I'm not sure if I want to use that or dive into using Atom or another standard text editor. Torn between wanting some live-preview feedback and not trying to think things through *before* putting them down. So I don't learn bad habits anymore than necessary.

## Nov 9
More CSS fun!

Finished up the relatively easy color/accessability work, and then moved on to some responsive design and flexbox CSS voodoo. A lot of this stuff is making quite a bit of sense (although there are still a few weird things), but I really need to go back and review some of the more basic layout fundamentals. I think I'm getting some of the moderate to advanced stuff, I think there's a bit of a gap in my understanding of the layout on a more fundamental level that is keeping me from really internalizing how some of this stuff is put together.

## Nov 8 
Got in about 15 minutes at 6:30 this AM before working all day. Super glad that I made the time.

Also, `<forms>` are still crazy to me for some reason. I'll need to do some more brushing up on them sometime soon.

Getting into colorblindess accessability guidelines. Right in my wheelhouse!
## Nov 7
Moved on from the CSS crazy stuff to some accessability. Relatively easy to remember this stuff, since lots of this has SEO functionality or carryover (`<alt>` attributes are important for search engines to recognize pictures and context), so not to bad. Stopped right before the combination of accessability and `<form>` combination, so we'll see how it goes tomorrow!

## Nov 6
Finished the CSS portion of the Freecodecamp and like normal, there seems to be a progression in the middle that I am not understanding as fast as they go through it. That's almost certainly since I'm doing this on my own (without lots of homework on constant immersion, but the idea of creating shapes out of divs with the `.Something::after` and `.something::before` sub-classes messes with my head. 

The animation stuff was pretty neat, but also I feel like I just have to constantly stare at the code to figure out how it's all put together. Overall, though, I feel like I know more now, and I'm not totally underwater! Hooray!

## Nov 5
More CSS fun. Skewing, hsl() for color, hue, and shading, complimentary and tertiary colors. Fun times!

## Nov 4
Lots more CSS today. This stuff is both logical and slightly confusing. I feel better and more secure about what's going on after spending even 15 minutes with it, but I'll be glad to get through more of this stuff and into the slightly more complex stuff that is going to be newer and (probably) harder to grok. Trying to make sure that I go slow enought to really comprehend what I'm doing now, though.

The `fixed`, `relative`, and `absolute` CSS position indicators are starting to make sense now, too. 

## Nov 3
More and more CSS. Going over things like variables, the specific heirerarchy of how the CSS works is pretty neat. I was working on a project last year that would have been quite a bit easier if I was a bit more familiar with the specifics of how these sheets worked at a deeper level, instead of trying to do research while solving problems!

## Nov 2
Been a couple of days since I last commented here, but I have been doing a bit of learning every day, although not quite as much as I want to d. So far *most* things are a review. The `<form>` HTML was a bit weird, and I need to make sure that I check up on the differences between the `.class` selector and the `#id` attribute, but so far most stuff has been a review.

## Oct 31
After reading the great blog article by  [Syk Houdeib](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-switched-careers-and-got-a-developer-job-in-10-months-a-true-story-b8895e855a8b), it inspired me to (once again) resume learning (in a structured way) basic and advanced web languages. 

I've gotten by for awhile on bits and pieces (and Google-fu), but I think a more thorough understanding of the basics will help me a lot in getting more freelance web devel work.

Started going through some of the great resources over at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and while the HTML stuff was pretty easy, I didn't realize how confusing some of the `<form>` code could be, since I've always done it via plugins. Phew.
  
  On to the CSS stuff tomorrow!
