# My-Code-Learning


## Oct 31
After reading the great blog article by  [Syk Houdeib](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-switched-careers-and-got-a-developer-job-in-10-months-a-true-story-b8895e855a8b), it inspired me to (once again) resume learning (in a structured way) basic and advanced web languages. 

I've gotten by for awhile on bits and pieces (and Google-fu), but I think a more thorough understanding of the basics will help me a lot in getting more freelance web devel work.

Started going through some of the great resources over at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and while the HTML stuff was pretty easy, I didn't realize how confusing some of the FORM code could be, since I've always done it via plugins. Phew.
  
  On to the CSS stuff tomorrow!
