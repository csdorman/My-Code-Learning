# My-Code-Learning

## Nov 6
Finished the CSS portion of the Freecodecamp and like normal, there seems to be a progression in the middle that I am not understanding as fast as they go through it. That's almost certainly since I'm doing this on my own (without lots of homework on constant immersion, but the idea of creating shapes out of divs with the `.Something::after` and `.something::before` sub-classes messes with my head. 

The animation stuff was pretty neat, but also I feel like I just have to constantly stare at the code to figure out how it's all put together. Overall, though, I feel like I know more now, and I'm not totally underwater! Hooray!

More CSS fun. Skewing, hsl() for color, hue, and shading, complimentary and tertiary colors. Fun times!

Lots more CSS today. This stuff is both logical and slightly confusing. I feel better and more secure about what's going on after spending even 15 minutes with it, but I'll be glad to get through more of this stuff and into the slightly more complex stuff that is going to be newer and (probably) harder to grok. Trying to make sure that I go slow enought to really comprehend what I'm doing now, though.

The `fixed`, `relative`, and `absolute` CSS position indicators are starting to make sense now, too.

More and more CSS. Going over things like variables, the specific heirerarchy of how the CSS works is pretty neat. I was working on a project last year that would have been quite a bit easier if I was a bit more familiar with the specifics of how these sheets worked at a deeper level, instead of trying to do research while solving problems!

Been a couple of days since I last commented here, but I have been doing a bit of learning every day, although not quite as much as I want to d. So far *most* things are a review. The `<form>` HTML was a bit weird, and I need to make sure that I check up on the differences between the `.class` selector and the `#id` attribute, but so far most stuff has been a review.

After reading the great blog article by  [Syk Houdeib](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-switched-careers-and-got-a-developer-job-in-10-months-a-true-story-b8895e855a8b), it inspired me to (once again) resume learning (in a structured way) basic and advanced web languages. 

I've gotten by for awhile on bits and pieces (and Google-fu), but I think a more thorough understanding of the basics will help me a lot in getting more freelance web devel work.

Started going through some of the great resources over at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and while the HTML stuff was pretty easy, I didn't realize how confusing some of the `<form>` code could be, since I've always done it via plugins. Phew.
  
  On to the CSS stuff tomorrow!
