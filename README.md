## Review: `<form>`, `<div>`, CSS flexbox, CSS grid `auto-fit` vs `auto-fill`

## Nov 12
Got the first project out of the way. Needed to have a bit of help by looking at the framework of an already-completed one, but I got it done and was playing around with some of the layout and CSS at the end. It's certainly not great, but I think it's a good start, and starting from scratch is quite different than modifying already-existing code.

Got done with the first section(s) of the FreeCodeCamp front-end learning! Now on to a few projects. I went ahead and made a CodePen.io account, but I'm not sure if I want to use that or dive into using Atom or another standard text editor. Torn between wanting some live-preview feedback and not trying to think things through *before* putting them down. So I don't learn bad habits anymore than necessary.

More CSS fun!

Finished up the relatively easy color/accessability work, and then moved on to some responsive design and flexbox CSS voodoo. A lot of this stuff is making quite a bit of sense (although there are still a few weird things), but I really need to go back and review some of the more basic layout fundamentals. I think I'm getting some of the moderate to advanced stuff, I think there's a bit of a gap in my understanding of the layout on a more fundamental level that is keeping me from really internalizing how some of this stuff is put together.

Got in about 15 minutes at 6:30 this AM before working all day. Super glad that I made the time.

Also, `<forms>` are still crazy to me for some reason. I'll need to do some more brushing up on them sometime soon.

Getting into colorblindess accessability guidelines. Right in my wheelhouse!

Moved on from the CSS crazy stuff to some accessability. Relatively easy to remember this stuff, since lots of this has SEO functionality or carryover (`<alt>` attributes are important for search engines to recognize pictures and context), so not to bad. Stopped right before the combination of accessability and `<form>` combination, so we'll see how it goes tomorrow!

Finished the CSS portion of the Freecodecamp and like normal, there seems to be a progression in the middle that I am not understanding as fast as they go through it. That's almost certainly since I'm doing this on my own (without lots of homework on constant immersion, but the idea of creating shapes out of divs with the `.Something::after` and `.something::before` sub-classes messes with my head. 

The animation stuff was pretty neat, but also I feel like I just have to constantly stare at the code to figure out how it's all put together. Overall, though, I feel like I know more now, and I'm not totally underwater! Hooray!

## Nov 5
More CSS fun. Skewing, hsl() for color, hue, and shading, complimentary and tertiary colors. Fun times!

## Nov 4
Lots more CSS today. This stuff is both logical and slightly confusing. I feel better and more secure about what's going on after spending even 15 minutes with it, but I'll be glad to get through more of this stuff and into the slightly more complex stuff that is going to be newer and (probably) harder to grok. Trying to make sure that I go slow enought to really comprehend what I'm doing now, though.

The `fixed`, `relative`, and `absolute` CSS position indicators are starting to make sense now, too. 

## Nov 3
More and more CSS. Going over things like variables, the specific heirerarchy of how the CSS works is pretty neat. I was working on a project last year that would have been quite a bit easier if I was a bit more familiar with the specifics of how these sheets worked at a deeper level, instead of trying to do research while solving problems!

## Nov 2
Been a couple of days since I last commented here, but I have been doing a bit of learning every day, although not quite as much as I want to d. So far *most* things are a review. The `<form>` HTML was a bit weird, and I need to make sure that I check up on the differences between the `.class` selector and the `#id` attribute, but so far most stuff has been a review.

After reading the great blog article by  [Syk Houdeib](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-switched-careers-and-got-a-developer-job-in-10-months-a-true-story-b8895e855a8b), it inspired me to (once again) resume learning (in a structured way) basic and advanced web languages. 

I've gotten by for awhile on bits and pieces (and Google-fu), but I think a more thorough understanding of the basics will help me a lot in getting more freelance web devel work.

Started going through some of the great resources over at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and while the HTML stuff was pretty easy, I didn't realize how confusing some of the `<form>` code could be, since I've always done it via plugins. Phew.
  
  On to the CSS stuff tomorrow!
